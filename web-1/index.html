      <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity. Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can
        only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data.</p>

      <div class="alert">
        <p>This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplicifation usually does.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.</p>

      <h3 class="headings">Questions</h3>

      <p>Please answer the following questions below. Remember to markup the information properly using HTML.</p>

      <h4 class="headings">Explaing the difference between the "alt" attribute and the "title" attribute.</h4>

      <p>
        The "alt" attribute supplies an alternative description for an element. For example, if a visitor comes to your site and an image fails to load, the text you added to your "alt" atribute will be displayed instead.
      </p>

      <p>
        The "title" attribute provides additonal information about an element. The "title" attribute will be shown to a visitor as well as the element itself. For example, hovering over a link that says "UALR" will display the title text you gave it as a small
        tool tip.
      </p>

      <h4 class="headings">Please provide an example of how to mark up a definiton from the dictionary below</h4>

      <p>
        By using the definition element, you can specify a term that is going to be defined somewhere in your content. You can attach an anchor tag to the definition term so it will always refer back to its defintion in your content. For example, let's take a
        look at <a href="#JavaScript-def">JavaScript.</a>
      </p>

      <h4 class="headings">Provide an example of link pointing to your favorite site</h4>

      <p>
        Here is an example of how to link to a favorite site. In order to achieve this, one must use the "href" attribute with an "a" anchor tag. The anchor tag defines the hyperlink. The "href" attribute specifies the link's destination.</p>

      <p>
        Here's a working link to my favorite website:
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&ab_channel=RickAstleyVEVO" target="_blank" title="Good Music">Click Me</a>
      </p>

      <h3 class="headings">Glossary</h3>
      <dfn id="JavaScript-def"><mark>JavaScript</mark></dfn> is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages. It is one of the world's most popular programming languages! Try it out
