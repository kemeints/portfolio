          <p>Are you new to the Destiny universe and looking for a veteran’s completely unbiased opinion? Yes? Well then, you’ve come to the right place future guardian! If you are not a newbie and are a veteran yourself, who is simply looking to solidify
            your belief in Destiny’s master class, then I welcome thee! If you are none of the above, you must be an internet troll so please go back to your cave. Okay, let’s start!</p>
          <h3 id="subsection-1" class="content">About This Seasoned Veteran</h3>
          
          <!--subsection-1 of primary content-->

          <p>I have played Destiny since <em>day one</em> of its original release date back in 2014 (#day1veteran). I’ve cumulatively logged over 4,500 hours in D1 (Destiny 1) and D2 (Destiny 2). I have successfully cleared over 430 raids between the two
            games. As one might imagine after being presented with these humble stats, I’m fairly versed in these games and I have a very small – practically nonexistent – social life. We’ll not talk about how the sun and I have become strangers either.
            Minor details.
            <p>

              <p>Now, don’t think I’ve limited my skills to only dominating in PVE (player vs environment). I’ve also become well versed in the PVP (player vs player) realm known as the <a href="#subsection-8">Crucible</a>. My <a href="#subsection-8">teabagging</a>                skills are on point and I thrive on the salty tears of the other guardians I defeat with my often times over powered loadouts. Some would say I'm a <a href="#subsection-8">sweaty</a> player but I'm just there to have fun.</p>

              <p>Well, that’s enough about me. Let’s get into the nitty gritty of my totally, 100% unbiased opinion on Destiny’s three classes.</p>
              <h3 id="subsection-2" class="content">Class Breakdown</h3>
              <!--subsection-2 of primary content-->
              
              <figure id="races"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/fHi9j97.jpg" alt="image of a hunter, titan and warlock"/>
              </figure>

              <p>As you first log into Destiny, you will be prompted to pick 1 of 3 character classes. This choice is difficult for many, so I’m here to help ease your concerns and make the choice as simple as breathing. Destiny 1 and Destiny 2 have the
                same three character classes to choose from so you don’t have to worry about making this daunting decision a second time in D2. The classes are as follows (they are most assuredly in no particular order of preference):</p>
              <ol>

                <li>The magnificent hunter</li>
                <li>The barbaric titan</li>
                <li>The frilly warlock</li>
              </ol>

              Each class has three different skill paths (subclasses) you can follow. Each of these subclasses has their own unique <a href="#subsection-8">super.</a>

              <p>Now that you’ve got your three class options, let’s delve into what exactly a hunter, titan and warlock are.</p>

              <h4 id="subsection-4" class="content">The Cheesiest Class: Warlock</h4>
              <!--subsection of subsection of primary content-->
              
              <figure>
                <img src="https://i.imgur.com/y8hc6Dg.png" alt="Warlock failing at jumping because they're bad" width="200" height="150" />
              </figure>
              
              <p>Have you ever wanted to don a dress and float around slapping aliens and other foes until they inevitably can’t take it anymore and parish into oblivion? Well then, the warlock class might just be for you!</p>
              <p>Warlocks have what we guardians call “space magic.” They are the intellectual class who have a “higher understanding” on what powers the guardians. This enables them to use special movement methods like “blink” which essentially teleports
                them from one place to another. This skill is particularly effective in PVP as it teleports you right into the face of another guardian, so you can give them a good up close and personal slap. Many warlock <a href="#subsection-8">mains</a>                are rather hoity-toity, so I prefer to avoid them.</p>

              <p>Essentially, all you need to know about warlocks is that they are easy mode which take no skill to use, their melee range is ridiculously long, and they have an insane recovery rate, thus making them <a href="#subsection-8">cheesy</a>. It's
                often you'll hear, <q><em>Did I just get mapped by another melee?! Friggin’ warlocks!</em></q> while in the crucible. They might not have a lot of armor wearing the dresses that they do, but they certainly make up for it with their recovery.
                They are not to be underestimated unfortunately.</p>

              <h4 id="subsection-5" class="content">The Fastest/Tankiest Class: Titan</h4>
              <!--subsection of subsection of primary content-->
              
              <figure>
                <img src="https://i.imgur.com/CsShoLK.jpg" alt="A badass titan rendition."/>
              </figure>
              
              <p>Do you have Attention Deficit Disorder, like sprinting towards bad guys like a one-way freight train, and enjoy punching things in the face with your fists? If so, the Titan class might just be for you!</p>
              <p>Titans are considered to be the “tankiest” class because of their armor. With the correct builds, titans take more damage to kill than your average pack of bears.
                <p>I call them one-way freight trains because of their special melee ability. It’s called a “shoulder charge” which will OHK (one hit kill) you. To pull off a shoulder charge, all a titan must do is start sprinting for a short time and then
                  run straight into you, killing you in the process. It’s as simple as that! There have been many salty tears collected in the crucible because of this.</p>
                <p>Titans also have an insane sprint speed. There are methods to chain the momentum of your jump/boost ability to propel the titan at alarming rates. This ability was nicknamed “titan skating” which made the class very appealing to those
                  that liked to “go fast.”</p>
                <p>I personally vouch for the overall fun factor that is included with titans. In my totally 100% unbiased, nonjudgmental opinion, titans are the second-best class to play (definitely better than the warlock).</p>

                <h4 id="subsection-6" class="content">The Craftiest, Best Looking, and Overall Dominating Class: Hunter</h4>
                <!--subsection of subsection of primary content-->
                
                <figure>
                  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/rAG62BL.jpg" alt="An even more badass hunter rendition." />
                </figure>
                
                <blockquote>"Hunters are genuinely the best, well-rounded class in Destiny." <cite>-The Internet</cite></blockquote>

                <p>Do you want to use the class with the most agile movement, coolest looking armor, throwing knives, and overall <u>best</u> abilities <em>and</em> neutral game? Well then, my fine friend, there is no other choice for you but the legendary
                  <strong><u>hunter</u></strong>.</p>

                <blockquote>"Never have I felt as cool and skilled as I do on my hunter. No other class can compare." <cite>– An unpaid actor</cite></blockquote>

                <p>Where do I begin?! Hunters are good for any situation. The hunter’s void subclass is an excellent team support class. It creates orbs of light for your team and weakens all enemies. This makes your teammates feel like superheroes and the
                  orbs of light enable them to get their supers quicker which is all around a good time.</p>
                <p>In D1, the arc subclass gave the hunter the ability to blink (which, if you’ll remember from the warlock, enables them to do a quick teleport). The hunter is much cooler though because instead of slapping the guardian like the warlock would,
                  the hunter would just knife them in the face. This ability was removed in D2 but with all the other amazing features of the hunter, it was no real loss.</p>
                <p>The hunter’s solar subclass can be paired with certain pieces of armor to enable them to inflict massive damage to bosses which is essential in most raids. No matter the situation, the hunter will thrive.</p>
                <p>Not that this has any relevance to my unbiased opinion, but the hunter class was my first ever played and currently still what I main. Don’t even get me started on the cloaks hunters get to wear! They are the peak of fashion in the Destiny
                  universe.</p>
                <blockquote>"It’s no contest. The hunter class character models have the best butts." <cite>– The Destiny Community</cite></blockquote>

                <h2 id="subsection-7" class="content">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>I’d like to close out this article by letting you know that statistics show over 90% of people who play as hunters lead better, healthier and more fulfilling lives outside of their game time. Who can argue with those 100% legitimate and
                  not made up statistics? Probably only warlock mains.</p>
                <p>I hope this article has been informative and helped any unsure new guardian lean towards the right choice when it comes to character class selection. Thank you very much for reading. If anything is unclear, I’ll close out with a famous
                  quote from Destiny 1.</p>

                    <dl>
                      <dt><b><u>Cheesy:</u></b></dt>
                      <dd>This is something considered by the community as a type of cheating the system or making encounters easier than they were intended to be (i.e. finding a spot on the map the boss can’t hit you at, yet you can kill him from. Or a melee
                        that kills you in two slaps and gives the warlock health, so they can continue their slapping rampage in crucible).</dd>
                      <dt><b><u>Crucible:</u></b></dt>
                      <dd>This is the game mode in which you can choose different playlists for PVP action. This is also where most of the sweaty players can be found.</dd>
                      <dt><b><u>Mains:</u></b></dt>
                      <dd>This term indicates players who “main” a certain class. These types of players are diehard fans who will defend their preferred class until they’re blue in the face. Even if they’re wrong.
                        <dd>
                          <dt><b><u>Super:</u></b></dt>
                          <dd>This is a very powerful – yet brief – attack mainly used to defeat stronger opponents in PVE or to go on rampages in the crucible. Each super is unique to the chosen subclass.</dd>
                          <dt><b><u>Sweaty:</u></b></dt>
                          <dd>This term refers to those that never take their tryhard pants off and always use the best guns/loadouts the game has to offer so that they can decimate anyone they come across (especially the noobs). They often try so hard they’ll
                            start sweating. Thus, the term “sweaty” was born.</dd>
                          <dt><b><u>Teabagging:</u></b></dt>
                          <dd>A term used to define couching up and down on a fallen foe’s face to either show your superiority or to humiliate/trigger the receiving party.</dd>
