              <h2>Writing Example 1</h2>
              <p>If you would like to take a look at an example of my writing abilities, feel free to click <a href="assets/resources/cybersecurityCode.pdf" download>here</a> to download a brief paper I wrote about an article
              called <i>Ethical Code for Cybersecurity</i>.</p>
              
              <h2>Writing Example 2</h2>
              <p>This is a bit more of personal writing example. I really enjoy writing in a fictional sense. I also like to make people laugh so I wrote this little story in hopes I may make someone out there laugh.

              <p>The goal of this project was to duplicate a website based on an image given to me. Below, you will find the image I was given. Hover over image to enlarge.</p>

              <h2>Soft Skills Project 1</h2>
              <p>This is a proposal I wrote for my Technical Writing class. The goal was to present an option for improving
              campus life and encourage economic growth around the University's campus. You can click <a href="assets/resources/campusRenovation.pdf" download>here</a> 
              for a PDF version of my proposal.</p>
              
              <h2>Soft Skills Project 2</h2>
              <p>If my degree in Anthropology taught me anything, it was how to analyze information and make informed decisions based on my understanding of the source material. For example, 
              you can click <a href="assets/resources/articleAnalysis.pdf" download>here</a> to see my interpretaion of an article called <i>The Communication Habits of Engineers</i> by Derek Steiner.</p>
