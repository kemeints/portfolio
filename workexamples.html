              <h2>Writing Example 1</h2>
              <p>If you would like to take a look at an example of my writing abilities, feel free to click <a href="assets/resources/cybersecurityCode.pdf" download>here</a> to download a brief paper I wrote about an article
              called <i>Ethical Code for Cybersecurity</i>.</p>
              
              <h2>Writing Example 2</h2>
              <p>This is a bit more of personal writing example. I really enjoy writing in a fictional sense. I also like to make people laugh so I wrote this little story in hopes I may make someone out there laugh.

        <div id="WebProject" class="tabcontent">
              <h2>Web Project 1</h2>
              
              <p>The goal of this project was to duplicate a website based on an image given to me. Below, you will find the image I was given. Hover over image to enlarge.</p>
              <img src="assets/images/websitePhoto.jpg" alt="Website Replication Photo" width="350" height="350" id="websitePhoto">
              <p>Here is my replication of the site: <a href="web-1/index.html" target="_blank" title="Web Project 1 URL">Website Replication</a></p>
              
              <h2>Web Project 2</h2>
              <p>During my Internet Technologies class - which is arguably my favorite class from my time back in school - our first "project" was to create a website covering something
              we were interested in at the time. This was back in 2018. At that time, I was really big into this game developed by Bungie called Destiny. I came up with the content in this site as a bit of a joke
              so it is not to be taken seriously. I wanted it to be fun. Feel free to take a look at my site right here: <a href="web-2/index.html" target="_blank" title="Web Project 2 URL">Destiny Website</a></p>

        <div id="Database" class="tabcontent">
              <h2>Database Project 1</h2>
              
              <p>The goal of this project was to create a database while showing the relational schemas and entity relationships. I was to use SQL coding to create and populate the database. I chose a media cataloging
              project because I'm a huge fan of Spotify and wanted to try and replicate something similar to it.</p>
              <p>You can find my project report here: <a href="database-1/assets/resources/mediaCatalogingProject.pdf" download>Media Cataloging Application</a></p>
              
              <h2>Database Project 2</h2>
              
              <p>This project centered more on designing a database system and showing all the working pieces of it. Components of the system include: a data flow diagram, a diagram 0 DFD, a use case diagram, a system sequence
              diagram, and a class diagream. For this project, I chose a hotel reservation system as it pertained to my job at the time.</p>

        <div id="Programming" class="tabcontent">
              <h2>Programming Project 1</h2>
              
              <p>This group project was completed in my Human-Computer Interface class. It was completed using only Java in Netbeans. As a group of 3, we were tasked with creating a user interface to add, modify, and delete
              user and website data. My job for the project was to add new websites, and modify existing website data. Our interface worked exactly as intended and our professor told us we created the best one in our class.</p>
              <p>While this won't show you the code we used, this link will take you to our presentation so you can see the final product:

        <div id="SoftSkills" class="tabcontent">
              <h2>Soft Skills Project 1</h2>
              <p>This is a proposal I wrote for my Technical Writing class. The goal was to present an option for improving
              campus life and encourage economic growth around the University's campus. You can click <a href="assets/resources/campusRenovation.pdf" download>here</a> 
              for a PDF version of my proposal.</p>
              
              <h2>Soft Skills Project 2</h2>
              <p>If my degree in Anthropology taught me anything, it was how to analyze information and make informed decisions based on my understanding of the source material. For example, 
              you can click <a href="assets/resources/articleAnalysis.pdf" download>here</a> to see my interpretaion of an article called <i>The Communication Habits of Engineers</i> by Derek Steiner.</p>

              <p>Below, you will find a link to my senior capstone project. I chose to create a website for a possible
