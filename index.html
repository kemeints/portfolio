                   Hello there and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Katelyn Meints. I am a post-baccalaureate senior at the 
                   University of Arkansas at Little Rock pursuing a degree in Information Science. I am most interested in expanding and developing 
                   my skills in Web Development though understanding and implementing network infrastructure is also a goal of mine. During my time in the workforce,
                   I played vital roles in providing technological support to my fellow coworkers. My time in school has expanded those skills and given me vital experience in 
                   programming languages like Java, Javascript and C++. Once I graduate, I will be looking for a career where I can continue to grow my technological skills and 
                   in turn help develop new and innovative solutions to modern-day problems in the workforce. 
                   </p>
                   
                   <p>
                   You can find my resume as well as a few examples of projects I have completed throughout my portfolio. If you have any questions, 
                   please feel free to contact me so we can discuss things further!  Thank you for taking the time to review my portfolio.

            <h2>Letter of Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>To whom it may concern,</p>
            <p>As a post-bachelorette student with degrees in both Anthropology and Information Science, I consider 
            myself to not only be technologically knowledgeable, but also culturally aware and sensitive to the needs 
            of others. My degree in Anthropology taught me the importance of keeping an open mind and respecting the beliefs 
            of others. As someone that has worked several years with the general public, keeping that respectful mindset
            has been exponentially helpful in my workplace successes.</p>
            
            <p>My degree in Information Science expanded my skillsets from psychological and analytical to technological 
            and information management.  I now have experience in programming languages such as C++, Java, and JavaScript. 
            I have learned the values of project management, database manipulation, and networking infrastructure. I chose 
            a degree in Information Science because of how all-encompassing it is. I have gotten to study and experiment in 
            so many different areas of the technological world which enabled me to find exactly what interested me most.</p>
            
            <p>It is my dream to combine what I have learned and gained from both of my degrees into one fulfilling career. 
            I am extremely goal oriented and I love being able to help others with their problems or needs. I enjoy the challenge 
            of learning new things and cannot wait for what more I will get to learn in the future. </p>
            
            <p>Please refer to the “Skills” tab for a detailed list of my skills. Additionally, you can view my resume from the 
            “Resume” tab. If you have any questions for me, please feel free to contact me.</p>
